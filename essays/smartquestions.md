  One of the things that everyone can relate to at some point in their life is the act of asking a question. The types of questions will vary, some may be easy to answer, others may be more complex. For programmers, the act of asking a question is especially relatable. As a programmer, there will come a situation in which you will become confused and have a hard time coming up with a solution to the problem. This may cause one to seek help from another source, whether that be the internet, a textbook, or a friend. Fortunately, there is a very convenient website called StackOverflow where programmers can go to receive help from another person. 
This is when it becomes important to realize the difference in asking a smart question and not. Unlike the time when you go to search the internet for a answer to your question, it is much more important to be able to ask a smart question on StackOverflow. There, it is a real person taking the time out of their day to answer your question, so asking a smarter question will save both the time of both you and the person answering your question.


## Not so Smart

  If there is a way to ask a smart question, then naturally there would be a way to ask a not so smart question. The following question is one such example. [This example](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28588915/how-do-you-write-a-line-of-output) taken from StackOverflow is a prime example of a question that does not follow the guidelines of a smart question. The very headline “How do you write a line of output?”, itself is a very simple question which could easily be searched up using the internet. The following details did not show any improvement in following the guidelines either. The person essentially proceeded to ask, “I don’t know how to output “Hello world”, pease help” without giving any further details. Needless to say, responses to such a question was met with criticism and lots of sarcasm. As the question made it quite clear that the person had not made any effort to finding the solution on their own, nor had they paid any attention to the material taught in class.


## A Smart Question

  On the flip side, [this question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75082069/error-loading-python-modules-when-embedding-python-in-c-openfoam) found on StackOverflow did follow the guidelines to asking a smart question. The headline made it clear what the subject was, and the further details also explained in depth what was occurring. The person also provided not only the code that they wrote, but also the error messages that were caused by the code. One can also see that an effort was made because the code they provided was a simplified version, such that anyone who looked at it would have a easier time figuring out what went wrong. They then followed it up by explaining their own attempts at finding a solution, and what the results of those attempts led to. The person ends it off by asking a clear cut question, rather than a broad one.


## Thoughts

  Reading through the guidelines of what differentiates a smart question from a normal (dare I say dumb) question, was extremely interesting. However complicated it may or may not seem, the guidelines are purely logical. You simply need to show that you put in the same amount of work and effort into the question that the person answering would also likely put in. Showing that you’re not simply being lazy and trying to take advantage of others is just the respectful thing to do, and naturally people would more likely to respond in kind. Not only that, but by asking smart questions, the fact that you’re more likely to receive smart answers means that not only you but the person answering will also have the opportunity to grow.
