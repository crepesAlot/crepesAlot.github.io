Coding can be a struggle. This is something that I have realized many, many times. Yet, despite the hardships I might face when working, I always come back for more. That's because I've found coding to be extremely fun, no matter how frustrated I get, the feeling of completing a program is probably one of my most favorite. Being introduced to the athletic software engineering has been a game changer to me as well. I've long since had the habit of procrastinating my assignments and doing them at the last minute, and I've never been able to break that habit despite some of my efforts. Yet I've already found that that won't work with this style of learning, and I'm actually quite appreciative of that. Having to do Workouts of the Day (WODs), even the practice ones, has really helped me learn more about coding. Unfortunately, I get super stressed out when working on these, as I get overly conscious of the timer, but I can't even bring myself to hate them because they are effective. I may hate the stress it brings, but I can't deny the sense of pride I get when I finish writing a piece of code within those 4 minutes.

## Javascript is Fun

Using javascript has been surprisingly pleasant. While I never got too in depth into the other coding languages, such as Java and Python, Javascript in comparison has been much easier to use. A major part of that may just be that I'm more used to coding now that I was when I was using those languages. So far Javascript seems to be a very good tool for software development. Not only is it easy to learn and use, but it is very flexible in the way it codes. I love how flexible Javascript is with its code. The ability to put different types of objects within arrays as well as functions, and being able to return a variety of things without having to convert them first is huge. Overall, Javascript is fun, convenient and I am greatly looking forward to getting more in depth with what I can accomplish with it.
