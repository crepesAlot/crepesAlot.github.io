There are many factors which can differentiate the novices from those who are more adept or experienced in their respective fields, and these factors will vary widely between professions. For programmers one of these factors would have to be design patterns.
# Experience is Everything
Learning about design patterns, and by extention, anti-patterns, is one of the biggest steps any newbie programmer can make towards becoming a better programmer. One of the most obvious things anyone new to a field can do to improve is to take advice from people more experienced from them. By learning design patterns, programmers can improve with this method in a much more effective way. <br>
<br>
Rather than blindly hurtling through a problem, and potentially creating a bigger tangled mess, it's much more efficient to take a look at the tried and true methods of our predecessors. By taking a look at these methods or templates, one can then build off it to fit their own needs, saving both time and effort. <br>

It is important to note that just because something works, doesn't make it the best way. <br>
<br>
Perhaps you want to remodel your house, or even do some redecorating. Looking at online designs and layouts is a great way to see how you might want to do things, but you can't simply go at it without any consideration for how the rest of the house. Randomly copying some designs may have part of your house looking very nice, but without proper consideration, the colors and designs might clash with the rest of your original house. <br>
<br>
Similarly, copy and pasting some code randomly into your own is bound to cause issues eventually. Adding any kind of new code without considering what you already have may end up working, but problems and conflicts can arise later on when attempting to make new additions. It's always important to take the rest of your code into consideration when attempting to use any kind of template.
