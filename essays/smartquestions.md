  One of the things that everyone can relate to at some point in their life is the act of asking a question. The types of questions will vary, some may be easy to asnwer, others may be more complex. For programmers, the act of asking a question is especially relatable. As a programmer, there will come a situation in which you will become confused and have a hard time coming up with a solution to the problem. This may cause one to seek help from another source, whether that be the internet, a textbook, or a friend. Fortunately, there is a very convenient website called StackOverflow where programmers can go to recieve help from another person.
