summary: "Personal project to change the textures of the base game of Minecraft."
---

This was a personal project that I worked on with friends in our spare time. We took heavy inspiration through other popular resource packs that have been used, while adding our own personal tweaks to them to fit our personal tastes. There was a lot of time and effort put into it, and it's still being changed to this day. Everytime the game updates, we not only have to update the version of the resource pack to keep it compatible with the new version of minecraft, but we also have to add any new textures that were added to the game. Granted, we don't change every texture of the game, since there are many textures that we are more comfortable with and doesn't need any type of change.

The coding for resource packs of minecraft is very minimal and simple. Most of the code is repetitive, simply going through every case that the texture may need to load. Some sample code can be seen below:
