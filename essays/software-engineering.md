# Home Design
Following the trend of important concepts in programming that saves a lot time and effort are design patterns. Design patterns are tried and true templates made over time by others which allows programmers to reuse code to suit their own purposes.<Br>
# Keeping it Organized
Following the trend of important concepts in programming that saves a lot time and effort are coding standards. Coding standards are very much a love-hate relationship.<br> Coding standards are a set of rules and guidelines that programmers need to follow when coding so that their code can appear organized. Doing so will allow both the programmer and anyone else who views the code to have a better understanding what each line of code does. Keeping your drawers and folders in your home and office labeled and organized can seem like a chore in the moment, but it definitely saves time and effort later on when you're trying to find that important something.<br>
Unfortunately, following all the conventions of coding standards can seem inconvenient and tedious in the moment. If you attempt to use someone else's code, and they haven't followed the same standard you are using, it can be a great pain trying to go back and fix it to match the rest of your code. 
However, keeping up with coding standards is a good method of keeping an organized workspace, which is a guaranteed way to make ones life so much easier when working.
